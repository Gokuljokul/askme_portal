The file /react-portal-docker/react-portal-docker/public/favicon.ico is intended to be a favicon file. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon.ico file separately. 

Please ensure that you place a valid favicon.ico file in the specified directory. This file is intentionally left blank.
